My C code:

* Licensed under Public Domain. Always.
* Compiles with Clang only. It __does not__ support GCC, MSVC or any other compiler.
* Targets Ubuntu OS only. If it works on any other OS, or if I add code for any other OS, it doesn't mean I support that OS.

My current development environment you can rely on when compiling my code:

Ubuntu 18.04.1 (x64), Clang 7.0, .deb dependencies from [c_ubuntu_dev_env](https://github.com/procedural/c_ubuntu_dev_env).
